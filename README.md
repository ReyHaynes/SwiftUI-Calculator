Swift UI Calculator Clone
--------------------

Gaining some general practice with Swift / SwiftUI by creating clone apps such as the Calculator app.

I still have a bunch to learn in Swift / SwiftUI. Everything was done while learning on the fly so feel free to send some suggestions!

### To Do
- [x] Create iOS Version
- [ ] Convert to Apple Watch App
- [ ] Convert to iPad App
- [ ] Convert to Mac App

### To Fix
- [ ] AC (All Clear) / C (Clear) button toggle & functionality
- [ ] Double.max shows infinity sign. (A good bug ðŸ™ƒ)
- [ ] Structure project better. (Still learning best practices with Swift apps)
