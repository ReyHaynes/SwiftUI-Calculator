Swift UI Calculator Clone
--------------------

Gaining some general practice with Swift / SwiftUI by creating clone apps such as the Calculator app.


## Notes
I still have a bunch to learn in Swift / SwiftUI. Everything was done while learning on the fly so feel free to send some suggestions!

I plan on doing a refactor of the CalculatorActions controller. It was created with the lack of awareness for core functions that would have helped reduce the code. Specifically, I was coding without knowing about `NumberFormatter`, which was added last minute to the DisplayView, and was preparing to create the visual format manually.
